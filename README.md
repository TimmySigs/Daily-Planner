# Daily-Planner


- I made this daily planner app to better use my time between work and school.
- The app gives a 9am-5pm schedule in which you are able to fill out the hours and save the reminders with the icons to the right, which will be saved to your local storage.
- I had some issues getting the reminder to be saved after reload but was able to figure it out.
- In the future id to see if I can make this into a full blown calender.
